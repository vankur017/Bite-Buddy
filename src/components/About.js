          Hi, Iâ€™m Ankur Verma, a Frontend Developer with a passion for crafting
          seamless user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from Lovely Professional University with a degree in Mechanical
          Engineering. Over the past one years, I've worked on numerous projects
          that involved React, Node.js, and other modern web technologies. My
          journey in tech began when I developed a small app in college that
          helped organize campus events.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise lies in JavaScript frameworks and UI/UX design. I enjoy
          building intuitive interfaces and optimizing web performance. I'm
          passionate about creating accessible web applications and believe in
          continuous learning and adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, playing guitar, and love
          exploring new technologies.
        </p>
